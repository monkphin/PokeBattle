# User Experience

PokeBattle is an online toptrumps like game created to allow fans of the Pokemon series and TopTrumps games to have a single player game that can be played online. Due to the nature of the game and the IP, the site needs to be relatively simplistic in its display as well as using a bright, simple colour pallette.
